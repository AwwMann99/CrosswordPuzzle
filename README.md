# CrosswordPuzzle
This is a turn-based crossword game where a player and a computer place words on a grid based on predefined rules. The computer uses the Min-Max algorithm to make optimal moves. The game ends when all words are placed or no valid moves remain. Scores are based on word lengths, and the highest scorer wins.
